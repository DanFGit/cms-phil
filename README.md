# CMS-Phil

A custom CMS for a friend's one-page development blog. 

The CMS Admin will be able to perform several actions on blog posts:

+ Add
+ Edit
+ Delete
+ Hide from public view
+ Organise the display of blog posts
+ Upload images and files

The CMS Admin will also be able to:

+ Change any image
+ Edit personal info
+ Edit the page colours
+ Upload a CV

The idea is that anyone could upload the source code to a server and use the CMS without programming knowledge.
